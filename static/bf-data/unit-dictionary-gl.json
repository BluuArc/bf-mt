Built with a special levitating apparatus, most wander aimlessly, although in some cases a few will brandish fang-like protrusions and attack. Preventing these attacks is difficult due to the inability to determine what causes them. As such, these automatons are classified as a threat to surveyors. The Akras Summoners' Hall offers a special reward to the individual who can discover the conditions that prompt these attacks, but it remains unclaimed at present."

Although all of the levitating automatons share forms reminiscent of sea creatures, no oceans have been confirmed to exist on Bectas at present. This is an exciting point for scholars interested in otherworldly oceans, as this is considered proof that oceans either exist on Bectas, or existed there in the past."

Zalts was also the one who convinced the emperor to build his own army, as his loyal service had won him his liege's trust. Unfortunately, he would eventually perish on the field after saving the entire army from a great crisis during the war for Elgaia's unification.

Had he lived to see what followed the founding of the empire and began involving himself in government affairs as a meritorious retainer, the political system would have been laxer, leaving more room for free expression.

Many of the theories are contradictory, but they all have one point in common; Melina is seen laughing, covered in the blood of gods. Cool-headed and never clouded by thoughts of malice, she always had her blades ready for the next target."

He was regarded as quite the talented disciple thanks to his great agility and stealth, which were perfect for conducting the secret missions his master usually entrusted him with.

Her power could be said to have been both a curse and a blessing, for it was her great power that drew the attention of the demonic wolves now known as the Grimm. It was also because of her power, and under the tutelage of the witch Semira, that Ciara was eventually able to finally rid the woods of all evil. Should the light of Semira's guidance not have reached Ciara, the girl would've ultimately been consumed by the darkness that plagued the woods. It is most likely that the Grimm would raise the young Ciara into a malevolent being of immense power, spreading their corruption beyond the woods.

The alluring and energetic performances she put on worked up a screaming, almost destructive aura that surrounded her; allowing her audience to let off their frustrations in the form of semi-frenzied dancing, as opposed to war."

After the controversy had died down, her masters decided to have her taught with specialized automatons through a personalized curriculum. Her preference for books over company only confirmed their choice, and soon the young magician was mastering the arts of war and magic by herself with the greatest of ease. Despite the explosive accidents and flesh-twisting incidents that she encountered in her lessons, she soon became one of her family-faction's greatest frontline warriors. With her ability to cast multiple offensive spells at a rapid-fire rate, it was only a matter of time before she surpassed her fellows with her unique, fluid method of fighting. Boredom soon saw her successfully petitioning the Vardket for permission to hunt wild predators in their many testing grounds, a privilege that they easily granted. A small cult of followers soon followed in her wake, each one eager to imitate her skill and success in the field. For the most part, she barely took any interest in anything that wasn't connected to magic, and so the news that the Vardket had disappeared without a trace was met with a long-suffering sigh."

Their investigations in barely-mentioned research facilities unearthed a treasure trove of discoveries. As expected, only those that were related to magic--even in passing--held her attention. It seemed that their studies into the nature of life and death went much deeper than anyone knew, and she spent weeks by herself studying the various texts that they had found. It soon led to a treasure hunt of sorts, with each find hinting at another barely-mentioned facility, each one's contents more grotesque and horrifying than the last. Some of the experiments had gone mad and attacked anything they came in contact with, while the others had retreated into a dormant state, lashing out when intruders were detected. Fortunately, her fighting skills and arcane arts were more than enough to see her through these trials, and the danger that they possessed sharpened her desire to find the Vardket's ultimate secrets. And find them she did--deep within an oft-forgotten research and weapon development facility with icy walls reeking of rotten flesh and screams. She found the location of a superweapon made to twist dimensions apart, fueled by the ritual sacrifice of thousands slowly being bled to a painful, torturous death. But she was not the first to find the information, and she quickly realized that those who supported the Vardket's return intended to reactivate the weapon as soon as possible. With fleet feet--and more merciful deaths than she had cared to admit--she rejoined her fellows and prepared for the worst."

In fact, the King's commanders were so confident of their victory that they permitted the various mercenary companies that clung to their legion's wake to attack ahead of the vanguard. While some of the insectile loyalists resented the privilege, the battle's outcome was never in doubt. Laresa joined the Ulnhann's call to arms, dividing her time between bringing the skyships under her command to battle readiness and preparing the ark ship for launch. To her astonishment, a recovery team informed her that they had unearthed Keres's soulcutter blade, a potent yet dangerous weapon that they had thought lost forever. No effort was spared in duplicating the weapon's power into smaller forms, and as the Vardket's deep-space sensor networks begain to sound the alarm, Laresa ordered the Vharag's small fleet to battle readiness. The plan called for a direct assault onto the enemy command ship--a risky gamble with a severely low chance of success. Meanwhile, the final preparations to launch the ark ship had begun..."

He understood the value of knowledge and had no qualms about adopting Deva military stratagem and technology to further his own cause. The renegade librarian Allanon discovered that Azurai was attempting to perform a second \"Ritual of Awakening,\" which if successful, would give Azurai the power of the Ancients--a power akin to one who has ascended to godhood. Azurai had already proven himself a warrior and conqueror without equal, but the success of the ritual would mark the imminent destruction of the Deva in his eyes, paving his way to conquer Eneroth by establishing a reign of terror. It is unclear what the full extent of the power of the Ancients truly is, but like their creators, Azurai may develop the means to travel across worlds and expand his dominion."

As a result, those in the kingdom have become longevous and more fertile, though this ultimately cost them dearly as the balance of life was taken from nature itself. The growth of the desert at their borders was increased at a great rate, hence the hasty construction of the wall to slow its advance.

As she arose, the Fuinsignum on her pelvis pulsed with a fiery light. Before she could inspect it, though, a horde of demons emerged from the island, howling for battle and flesh."

Every death--whether it was by rending claw, acid spit, searing fire or crushing limbs--ended in the same way. She arose whole and unharmed the next day, her Fuinsignum dully burning against her skin in the morning dawn. At first, she wondered why she was given this \"gift.\" Was it a sick joke by some half-forgotten god? Or was there a more sinister plan at work? Fragments of her old life flashed before her eyes, yet they seemed to slip away with each new sunrise. Soon, the only thing that drove her forward was the memory of the demon that robbed her of her child. It would pay for the slight, no matter how many times she had to walk through a blood-soaked hell to find it. Oh, how it would pay."

Yet it also bore a burden that its creator did not expect nor understand: fear. As it opened its eyes and gazed upon the land, it understood that it had to find the heroes of its time as quickly as possible. For the land that it had emerged in was a ruined landscape where the enemies of all mortals reigned free, and humans were forced to hide from their ever-roving eyes--or worse. al-Akqat searched tirelessly for the bearers of hope, and for a time it seemed all was lost. But in a small cave untouched by the Raug, al-Akqat found an odd ally who had formed a rag-tag group who were valiantly attempting to resist the demonic tide wherever it found them. Interestingly enough, they bore the all-too-familiar Fuinsignum on their bodies, and fate seemed to lead them to others who had the mark as well. Thus did their journey begin, with a return to the island of dark Fuindor."

The web was thickly woven indeed, as the Hall of Worlds shattered and rewove itself as it regurgitated al-Akqat's former companions before the wandering spirit. While overjoyed at their reunion, it soon realized that the weft and weave of fate had come into significant disarray. They quickly regrouped with the others and fended off the demons that had been left on the island. It seemed that the Raug had taken their leave of Fuindor and moved their operations much closer to their intended goal: the demon-infested Imperial Capital. As they began their return to the mainland, al-Akqat sensed that their fate had much more in store for them than it had expected. Fear began to worm its way into its heart, and it seemed that all of its work would be for naught."

Once, she was dragged back home by the village authorities for beating up a group of boys who teased her a little too much. Despite her temperament, Feng also had a much softer side.

She was convinced that the power she needed to protect them could only be found beyond the mist of the Eastern sea. Bidding her parents farewell, Feng left for Grand Gaia just as Long did. Several years later, the gods began their war against the denizens of Grand Gaia. The people of Krung-go held on to their beliefs that the mist of the Eastern sea would keep them out of sight - but the gods were not blind. The god's armies soon arrived at their shores and overwhelmed the defenses of Krung-go. When it seemed that all hope was lost, what appeared to be the mythical fire bird of legends descended from the sky and set ablaze the army of the gods. Worn out and shaken by days of battle, the old heroes Fei and Fang were filled with immense pride and joy as they knew only too well who it was that came to their rescue. From the fires emerged the woman they called their daughter, together with the young warrior that saved them years ago. Together, they guided their people across the Eastern sea to meet up with another warrior from the Agni Empire, a hero who fought to protect the people fleeing into Elgaia. "

Grandt welcomed the pain, for it distracted him from his thoughts of his battle with the mechanized demigod. With Elaina's help, Grandt fashioned a functional arm from the high-tech biomechanical parts strewn around the battlefield to replace what he lost. They parted ways shortly after: Elaina to chase her obsession with finding the missing Elysian princess, and Grandt to repair his ruined weapons. Augmented at last with powerful alien technology, the weapons were more powerful than before--but he was in no shape to use them.

Perhaps it the passionate zeal of youth, but many slingers simply shrugged off those well-meaning warnings. Sometimes you have got to live it up a little! Before long, the rather public condemnation had lost its momentum, and these bold displays of clever top-tinkering are now a mainstay of competitive top spinning.<br><br>As for Kagiya, she was certainly pleased with the way the community was now ablaze with passion. Kagiya continues to compete to this day, although her goal of becoming the world's number one slinger hasn't been as much of a priority.

Her journey to bring down the callous gods of Grand Gaia alongside her sisters-in-arms is a saga for the ages: a tale of bravery and resilience in spite of hardship and defeat.<br>Cayena's newfound strength was a testament to the unbreakable bonds the Maidens had forged throughout the years.

Feurig roared with fury as Cayena fired barrages of rockets upon the enemy, burning them all in the fires of justice. <br>Although the gods possessed limitless might, the Battle Maidens stood steadfast in their assault.

She lay on the battlefield, grinning at the brightening sky.<br>Grand Gaia hailed the Maidens as heroes, and Cayena was especially lauded as a paragon of might among the military nations. However, Cayena turned down all invitations to be made a general of any army; war for war's sake was never her aim, and the concept of \"justice\" could easily be twisted for nefarious ends.<br>These days, Cayena enjoys training and sharing her experiences with aspiring soldiers. She has become something of an idol among warrior communities, but when asked, she laughs boisterously and waves it off."

He is always clad in steel and thick garments, and his penchant for extraordinary chaos suggests a demonic heritage.

However, he was reluctant and wished to be free and travel across Grand Gaia with his best friend and closest Warrior partner - Kuraginn. After defeating countless enemies, Kurewa revealed his inner desire and asked Kuraginn to travel the world together with him.

Sugar, spice, and everything nice...these were not the ingredients she chose to achieve her goals, however. Vikki wanted something more sinister--a magical source of infinite power! With some luck, it came to her attention that colorful eggs endowed with mystical powers could be found in the world known as Grand Gaia. Convinced that the eggs were the perfect final ingredient, she dispatched her faithful minion (and pet) Cotton with a mission: to collect all the mystical eggs at any cost! Laughing (diabolically), Vikki proclaimed that Paskua would soon fall into the clutches of her ebil paw. Perhaps when she became Paskua's Overlord its people would finally start paying attention to her."

In her (diabolical) quest to conquer Paskua, Vikki armed her minion (and pet) with her prototype war machine and sent it to retrieve the mystical colorful eggs of power from the land of Grand Gaia. According to one particular source, Vikki was a lonely and somewhat awkward girl who only wanted someone to pay attention to her and discuss about her interest in robots. Her attempts at communication only served to frighten and drive people away, which eventually lead to the development of her ebil--Vikki's so-called enlightened form of evil--ways. Unfortunately, there is no way to verify the credibility of said source. But if it were true, all it would take to stop Vikki from walking the path of ebil would be for someone patient and kind enough to stop and listen to her for once. Perhaps someone with a kind soul, and maybe some sweets, could open Vikki's ebil heart."

In times of peace, she would have been an athlete, or a politician--but the battlefield was her birthplace and her home. She was the best fighter among their ranks, efficiently battling armies with ease as her weapon curved and bent at impossible angles to cut down her enemies. Some, however, said that her enthusiasm was merely a pretext for her more murderous urges. Indeed, her moniker was inspired by the charnel house that she would happily leave in her wake. Many who argued against her actions soon found themselves the victims of \"accidents\" and learned to hold their tongues. Unfortunately, this meant that she had fewer opponents to spar with to hone her skills--a fact that she lamented to the Vardket. She found her match, however, against the dark-skinned giant of the Vharag and his soul-eating blade. They became friends of a sort, and it was rumored that she always asked him for advice on such things as how to lead her faction, how to be a better warrior, and how (it was rumored) she could escape the noisy crowds in her mind. When the news of the Vardket's disappearance reached her ears, none could have prepared for the shout of glee that escaped her lips."

While Galea was personally disappointed that she was not able to match blades against the others in their scuffles, the voices in her head spurred her eagerness to find out more about the Vardket. It was a good call. As they delved deeper into the secret laboratories and testing grounds, they found more and more evidence that their alien masters had no real idea of what they were doing. Indeed, while they did possess technologies that allowed them to uplift entire planets, their comprehension of war was severely lacking. It seemed that they had no long-term plan to actually fight the enemy that they had trained the God-Killing army for, and had fallen into infighting in the last few days of their reign before departing off-planet in a panicked rush. Many of their experiments were consequently left behind, including a superweapon that had been reactivated for nefarious purposes. It was then that Galea received a transmission from her sparring partner and almost-friend, informing her that there was a million-to-one plan underway to stop the weapon from being fully operational. With yet another gleeful grin, she joined the expedition into the depths of an alien hell."

As the God-Killing Army's vanguard and anti-elite troops, a death was a vacancy that needed to be filled by the living as soon as the fighting was over. Ravea's plan of action as soon as she stepped in to lead her family-faction came, however, as no surprise. The quiet sniper withdrew all of the surviving Khree into their family-faction's territories and declared that they would be taking a defensive stance in the meantime. They managed to reactivate one of the few remaining deep-space sensors, but the picture was not very encouraging. Orebus's defensive satellite system had gaping holes in its networks, and information was sporadic at best. Ravea took to scaling the mountains and looking skyward, her eyes trying to pierce the heavens and see the ships of their enemy. The Vharag launched several rockets into space, each carrying scavenged microsatellites to provide some form of sight beyond the black. Finally, their efforts paid off: a small swarm of outriders were spotted approaching Orebus, with a single scout descending from orbit. She wasted no time and climbed the nearest summit she could find, bracing her bow as she mentally calculated the ship's route. As it arrogantly hovered over the land, she drew her bow, aimed, and let the arrow fly with practiced ease. As the shot blew a hole in the ship's engine, she ordered her aides to inform the others that the enemy had arrived--and that his ship had crashed to the south..."

It seemed that the enemy was overconfident in their superior numbers--a flaw that Ravea intended to point out (both literally and figuratively) to her fellow commanders. As they assembled at the convocation, they hammered out a two-pronged plan of attack: the bulk of the God-Killing Army would engage the Dust-Yellow King's armada in suborbital positions, with a strike team assaulting the command ship at the earliest opportunity in order to cripple their leadership. In the meantime, a much smaller force led by a single battleship would escort the newly-discovered ark ship on its maiden voyage. With no other viable options left, they began the arduous task of preparing the planet's defenses. Several months would pass, and during that time Ravea made sure that the Khree knew what they were up against. This was not going to be a clean fight, but a close-quarter knife fight with extremely low chances of success. Soon, their alarms began to ring out loudly, proclaiming their enemy's arrival. Night turned to day as the anti-orbital guns on Orebus roared again and again, and each explosion brought down ships aplenty from the skies. But she knew that this was just the beginning, and as she joined the others in the assault torpedoes, one could see the grim determination in her eyes."

Had she obeyed her mentor's instructions and remained in Myrranthia, it was very likely that she'd eventually inherit her mentor's title of Archmage, a position only held by the Deva's most powerful and accomplished mage. In her quest for fame and glory, Haile's reckless pursuit of knowledge and power coupled with her startling naivety towards matters of the world, would have made her a dangerous foe for the Morokai. As her powers grew, the irrational disdain and hate towards the Morokai that was sown into all Deva children would grow. And once her powers have fully matured, Haile would become a prominent Champion of the Deva and a terrifying bane to the Morokai.

It knew, somehow, that the hearts of mortal things lay at the center of the mystery, yet not why this knowledge was within its grasp. As it became aware of its surroundings, it realized that the shredded bodies of once-mortal demons lay around it, ripped apart by the energies it inadvertently unleashed. Surprised with this knowledge, it felt the binding rooted in the Fuinsignum growing in strength. It seemed that the more it interacted with this plane, the more tightly its fate was wound to a narrative that would end in its demise. An odd fate, then, for a deathless spirit. Eager to explore the new realm that it found itself in, it began its journey and found a wayward group of individuals, each one marked with the Fuinsignum on their bodies. It understood that a mysterious, distant force was bending fate to bring them together somehow, and that with its intervention, the answer to its conundrum could be found. Yet even as it joined them in their journey, it knew one truth: that the end of its present incarnation would come at the hands of its fire-bearing companion..."

    "description": "Born with an insatiable curiosity about how the world worked, Astrid lived a rather charmed life. The orphan girl devoured books far more easily than food or drink, with her nights spent huddled by a lamp as she read about princesses and adventures in far-away lands. It took her mind off the war that reduced the once-proud city she called home with her royal family into a hellhole for those who had no choice but to stay there. As she grew up, she began to explore the city in earnest on her own. To her surprise, she found a secret passage to a long-abandoned library deep under the surface, filled with decaying tomes and mysterious magical trinkets. It was here that she felt a mysterious call drawing her to a box that contained a grimoire of spells and a deck of divining cards. But the artifacts, long masterless, battled her in a contest of wills. At last, their resistance was broken as they swore loyalty towards the young mage. Astrid returned to the city above, only to find it set ablaze as the demonic horde finally pushed past its exhausted defenders. In a panic, she called upon her spells, but the power she wielded was too much for her to handle, and she drowned in its embrace. She woke up in an abandoned cavern, a burning genii and a pale vampire by her side as the Fuinsignum revealed itself on her body. Frustrated at her lack of mastery, Astrid began her long journey towards mastering the magical power that she had attained."

It was a bit much for the young girl, who preferred to work on understanding the artifacts of power that had somehow accompanied her across time and space. Life on the run from demons of all shapes and sizes wasn't easy, but she managed to cope. Under the genii's tutelage, she summoned a potent spirit that would aid them in their battle against evil, although its wounds upon its arrival disturbed her greatly. It was with the spirit's help that they located a vault of forgotten weapons--or so they thought. What they found was even more disturbing: a half-demonic berserker, somehow abandoned by its Raug masters. After calming it down and laying several binding spells on its soul, they found out that while the warrior was a potent fighter, he also had more than his share of reckless youth. Despite her misgivings, her care for him soon led to unsaid attraction--a matter that she refused to give voice to. Their adventures together would lead them first to the accursed island of Fuindor, where they found several surprises awaiting them, before leading them back to the mainland in search of answers. But she would soon wake upon their return with several members of their company missing, and the stink of betrayal leading her pained heart to the heavens she no longer dreamed of..."

But one winter morning, the cold harshness of human hearts found its way to his doorstep. Kitsu was forced to make a choice: to save a child he barely knew and sacrifice what little fortune he had, or save himself and let it die. With a muttered curse, he ordered the spirit to take the child away as he drew his blade. The next thing he remembered was waking up in the snow, bleeding yet still alive. Despite his injuries, he somehow managed to pull himself together, although he ruefully faced the reality that he might not wield the sword the same way again. In his travels, it seemed that many had heard of the tales about his exploits and were eager to test their skills against his--a matter that he found quite maddening. Countless moonlit escapes had him running across rooftops and exploring the many ways of distracting his pursuers with what was on hand--roofing tiles, buckets of dirty water, and other unmentionable things. Ugh, tiles. After several weeks, it was a relief to finally find a peaceful tavern where he could enjoy a drink. Well, he tried to--until an odd-looking young man suddenly popped up next to him.

Vail emerged from the blizzard accompanied by the creature--partners, he said, although he would say little else on the matter.

In the middle of the chaos, some individuals reached out to Vail and Vidron, proposing mutual alliances in the name of profit and power.

From this strange vessel an alien entity was born—Tsovinar. She quickly adapted to her new suboceanic home, gaining mastery over the abyss and its myriad moods. Her godlike control over hurricanes, tsunamis, and tidal waves led early human settlers by the sea to worship her as a deity—Tsovinar of the West. Believing these natural disasters to be symbols of her fury, the settlers began sacrificial rituals in a bid to appease their goddess. Sensing she could manipulate these mortals to her whims, Tsovinar accepted the offerings, granting them her blessing. Little did the humans know of the alien essence that took root within their bodies; it spread through every generation that followed, and eventually, the wretched half-serpent Naga race was born. Although all within Tsovinar's immense watery domain bowed to her, a ravenous hunger welled up within her soul - the desire to plunge this world into the Endless Abyss from which she was born, so that she can become its ultimate ruler."

Tsovinar yearned to plunge Aimyhr into the Endless Abyss and become its ultimate ruler. By taking advantage of the cataclysmic chaos in the surface world wrought by the Void Rendering, she ordered her abyssal army of deep sea monstrosities, pelagic horrors, and her faithful Naga swarms to overrun the surface-dwellers in an event known as The Surging Tide. Trapped between the nightmarish void plague and the abyssal invaders, the kingdoms of Aimyhr were each brought to their knees, fearing the worst. At their darkest hour, a band of mighty heroes championing the other three Tetra Arcadia appeared, bearing blessings from Zeruiah of the North, Juno-Seto of the East, and N'an-Wang-Mu of the South. With their combined efforts, Tsovinar was struck down into the Endless Abyss from whence she came and sought to spread. The abyssal invaders, disoriented by rage and confusion, slithered back into the murky ocean to mourn their fallen mistress. Henceforth, it was known in history that on that fateful day, the tyrannous Tsovinar was sealed beneath the waves, never to resurface and threaten to swallow the world again. And yet, the Naga still believe their alien goddess is merely biding her time...so that when opportunity presents itself, she will once again rise to claim the surface world of Aimyhr for the Endless Abyss."

Legends tell that in ancient times, a gigantic floating tree drifted in the skies for a hundred years before disappearing. Frozen creeks transformed into flowing rivers, and temperate vegetation sprang forth in a mystical miracle. The Vale became a bastion for various types of wildlife, and a host of the Fae spirits. The Fae were good-natured, innocent, and made the woods ring with merriment everyday. However, great danger loomed over them in the form of invading goblin hordes that were attracted by the food, as well as magical energies, of the Vale. The Fae were no match for the savagery of the goblins, and were driven back. In their dark hour, they congregated at a massive tree that had sprouted at the center of the Vale and began chanting. Thousands of voices soared in harmony as their myriad of wills and desires for a guardian savior  culminated in a blinding pillar of turquoise light that sundered the clouds high above. The final manifestation of this bewitching event was a mythical deity brought to life. She was known as Zeruiah, and all the Fae bowed before her in reverence."

Drawing on her divine powers, Zeruiah erected wards and summoned raging blizzards that would keep out evil monsters. For countless millennia, the Vale flourished and expanded under the protection and rule of Zeruiah. The Fae channeled and constructed majestic Vaults in which they stored all sorts of treasures, tomes and artifacts collected or crafted over the ages. Knowledge of these Vaults gradually leaked to the world outside, and many civilizations sought to gain entry into the Vale, fueled by greed and curiosity.

The Fae and animals initially assisted the girl with sustenance at Zeruiah's command, but she was eventually brought into the heart of the Vale. Despite her mistrust of humans, Zeruiah grew to love the girl, training and watching her grow up.

    "description": "The life of mortals is like grass--they flourish like a flower of the field. As the decades became centuries, Zeruiah grew to realize how fleeting human life was. She became colder and disillusioned with forming relationships with humans. She turned her attention away from the petty politics of the warring mortal civilizations, and focused on the scholarly pursuit of otherworldly artifacts and space-time anomalies. The mystical Vale in the North adopted isolationism, with ancient wards and Fae illusion magic keeping out all but the most determined and magically adept intruders. Between meditations within the heart of the majestic World Tree, Zeruiah studied and observed other planes of existence as well as the intricacies of dimensional Stargates. It was through this that Zeruiah discovered the otherworldly deity called Juno-Seto. Their worlds connected through extraordinary circumstances, and their fateful encounter led to a series of historical events culminating in the cataclysmic crisis known as the Void Rendering. For the first time in a thousand years, Zeruiah was overwhelmed by conflicting emotions--her reluctance to expose the Vale and her people to peril, her guilt for indirectly endangering her world, her concern for Juno-Seto, and her uncertainty of victory over the Voidborn. Nevertheless, the sudden memory of the human girl she had saved long ago sparked her resolve, and Zeruiah marched her Fae to war. After a long campaign, countless hard-fought victories, and with the mortal civilizations allied, Zeruiah finally drove the invaders back into the Void. The turning point was without a doubt Juno-Seto's tremendous sacrifice of relinquishing her own divinity to seal Ensa-Taya. Even as the celebrations of victory erupted all across the world, news and rumors of Zeruiah's aid and Juno-Seto's sacrifice spread like wildfire, inspiring many pilgrimages to the towering Crystalline Spire for people to pay their respects. As for Zeruiah, she re-opened a portion of the Vale that eventually became the greatest center of Research and Academics in the world. To this day, her legendary feats during the Void Sundering and beyond are still sung in ballads, with one particularly interesting account from a renowned poet describing how the meadows around the World Tree bloomed pale pink and lavender iris fields sprung from the earth overnight.

    "description": "Embittered at their unexpected defeat, Wannahon reluctantly agreed to the truce forced by Durumn upon the Greherd. Even the news that the Vardket had truly abandoned them with no explanation failed to shake his resolve. It was all a test, his creation assured him--one that he could not afford to fail. Determined to vanquish the opposition, Wannahon used the time gained from the truce to rebuild the Greherd's armies and amassed resources that fueled their war machine. As he pursued his research with the brightest minds his family-cadre could offer, it became clear that their defeat exposed the weaknesses in their weaponry and tactics. It wasn't good enough to beat the unbelievers, so how could it defeat those that defended the gods? Driven to the point of despair, it was on a lonely night that Wannahon discovered his greatest breakthrough: by combining his body and mind with forbidden Vardket technology, he could exceed the limits that his meager form contained, and gained even more power. Astonished, he spread the news to his fellows, and it was not long before they attempted lesser versions of his black miracle on themselves. Despite their horrifying failures, their few successes allowed them to develop even larger, more robust war machines. With his newfound power, he was able to upgrade his own juggernaut--a hulking machine that spat out a thousand terrible deaths upon the unfortunate. Flesh-eating bacteria, metal-melting acids, bone-shattering sonic waves and much more could be found in his arsenal. The voice of his creation, no longer a mere whisper, encouraged him to go further in his research. At last, he gathered his most loyal followers in secret at the site of an experimental Vardket superweapon and struck once again at their enemies, determined to make his masters hear his cries--even if it meant howling to the stars from the corpse-covered peak."

Their ranks thinned after Ceulfan's disastrous alliance with Wannahon, she decided to make the most of things and took the survivors underground as they regrouped and rebuilt their strength. While some felt that her soft-spoken personality was initially a poor fit for the role, she soon proved them wrong with her sharp memory and keen--almost obsessive--attention to detail. Of course, sending some of her more aggressive rivals flying into reinforced walls probably helped her cause. It was deep below the surface that they found hidden laboratories where the Vardket had kept their largest titans of war-bioengineered behemoths, crafted from a variety of creatures, that could easily topple mountains and break seas. Dessit soon set the remaining Forshu to work in mastering these abandoned weapons and stockpiling whatever equipment they could find. She kept an eye on matters occurring on the surface, and one day she was alerted to an incident in the south of the continent: an alien craft was spotted crashing there, with some speculating that it belonged to their ancient enemy..."

She immediately ordered the Forshu to begin planning for the inevitable assault as she busied herself with reactivating as many of the planet's defensive networks as she could lay her hands on. She hated having to interact with the other commanders --the wounds of their defeat still weighing heavily on her heart--but she knew that she had to swallow her pride in light of the bigger picture. Soon, the other family-factions would find their own efforts being mysteriously aided at the most opportune times, Dessit's assistance hidden behind layers of machinery and obfuscation. After several months, the all-too-familiar klaxon of their deep-space sensors began to ring in alarm, and their screens were quickly filled by the chaotic swarms of their enemy's space craft. As the battle raged above, it was clear that the defenders were going to be overwhelmed by the sheer numbers that their enemies had brought with them. Dessit immediately gave the order for the Forshu to deploy, and their behemoths seemed to turn the tide of battle. But a golden sarcophagus-flagship began to descend from the heavens, the land rendered silent as a terrible heat began to make itself felt..."

She had a duty to protect and raise the person who was her last ray of sunshine in a god-forsaken world. Unfortunately for them, fairy tales did not exist in Baldemar, as they lived in a world of strife and anarchy, where the strong fed upon the corpses of the weak. Slavers stormed into their hut one night and seized her. No matter how hard she fought and screamed, she could not resist the slavers.

While Azurai's officers saw Nyala as a threat, the overlord saw immense potential in her. He offered her two \"choices\": to become his disciple, or forever lose the one thing she held most dear. To Nyala the answer was clear, thus her brutal training began. She went on to exceed all of Azurai's expectations, mastering the art of espionage, assassination, interrogation and torture. Using all the newly acquired skills at her disposal, Nyala finally tracked down her sister's whereabouts.

Every spirit that they consulted, though, spoke the same answer: that there was no hope for their union to have children. It was only in the farthest reaches of a forgotten library where they found a map to the island of Fuindor, where even the darkest of miracles was possible. Their search for knowledge, however, brought them to the attention of the Inquisition. Hounded by their enemies, Nimune wept tears of verdant scarlet as she held the bleeding body of the only man she loved. It was at this moment that she swore bitter revenge as his blood mingled with hers, burning a mystical mark into her soul. She would search for a way to bring him back to her side, even if she had to squeeze the life out of every mortal she met..."

As she explored her surroundings and saw the hordes of demons around her, she realized that she had arrived at the island of Fuindor. Yet her joy was tempered by her grief, and she soon set herself to work. Soon, the tainted land answered her mystic summons, and she soon set off on her quest to find the secret that would allow her to defy death itself. But her work was fraught with frustration, for the magic that she tried to wield slipped from her hands with an unnatural strength when she needed it the most. Demons searched for her ceaselessly, and while she didn't attract any attention from the infamous Raug overlords, it was only a matter of time before her work would be noticed. Yet she managed to gain some progress here and there, with her work finally allowing her to open a small hole to the underworld momentarily and call the soul of her husband back to her side. Having sealed the essence of her beloved in a specially-grown phylactery, she began the search for the second stage in her plan: a body for her love that could endure the test of time. To her surprise, a demon appeared by her side one night, with a message from the Raug..."

The spirits scattered to the wind, and the forest began to buckle under assaults of fire and blood.

The survivors would use their magical flutes to lure the men one by one into deep caves, where they would trap and leave them to die of starvation.<br><br>Years passed, and the once peaceful fauns honed and perfected the art of offensive magic. Though their instruments were now replaced with wands and staves, the fauns quietly wished for memories of better days, when their flutes played the cheerful song of life. And that's when one brave faun girl sought to make this wish come true by seeking the guidance of an eternal deity..."

Broken and charred by the hateful fires of men, the deepwoods were a black, tangled twist of cruel bark and thorns. Not even the hardiest of forest creatures dared to forage there. Pulling out her panpipes, she imitated the sorrowful cadence of that phantom voice, and before long, they began to play in unison.<br><br>A flood of anguish and loneliness entered her heart, chilling her to her core. The eternal deity was weeping, and it was so heartbreaking that Miell found her own cheeks wet with tears.

Heartened by its response, Miell continued her songs.<br><br>Miell never returned to her clan, and the fauns believed she was felled by some beast or human along the way. But those who skirt the darkwoods find it is not as twisted as they remembered it to be. Beams of sunlight now filter through the gaps in the wilting thorns, and a light blush of budding green can be seen poking through the ashen soil. If you listen carefully, you might just make out the lilting tune of panpipes."

Eager to learn the arts of war, she was considered quite the prodigy by her superiors, and her rapid ascent within the ranks of the Ulnhann was no surprise to anyone. Born with an uncanny sense of closeness with her faction's serpentine mounts, it didn't take long before the Vardket took notice and ordered that she be trained for leadership as part of the vanguard for the God-Killing Army's invasion. Despite her short temper, she became one of the most prominent candidates to lead their family-faction in the planned war. The news of the Vardket's disappearance, however, shocked the faction into stagnation and infighting as their leaders accused one another of betrayal to their masters. It was the Greherd-led attack that galvanized them into action, with the furious Durumn knocking the opposition off their feet, quite literally. With her no-nonsense attitude and stalwart courage, she succeeded in uniting the Ulnhann into the cohesive fighting force that they were trained to be. Despite relentless skirmishes with Greherd forces, they managed to hold their ground and push their attackers into a stalemate, but not without a price. As the smoke cleared, Durumn's arm hung uselessly from her side, the bones within crushed into a fine powder while the flesh was left intact after a near-miss with a Greherd cannon. The injury, amputation, and subsequent replacement of her fleshy arm with a mechanical one did nothing to dampen the sweet taste of victory, however. Yet Durumn saw the look of rage in the eyes of her opponents and knew that this had only been the beginning."

With the experience gleaned from their first fights, Durumn quickly began the arduous task of training soldiers with their newfound knowledge and strengthening their arsenal of serpents, warriors, and tactics. It was clear that the Ulnhann, though successful, could still improve in many areas. Despite controversy over the Vardket's disappearance, her efforts to focus their energies into their future bore much fruit. It was to their shock and surprise that they discovered a trap laid by the Greherd--a virus that caused their egg-laying mounts to bear fewer spawn, marred by sickness and frail bodies. Angered by this turn of events, Durumn ordered and personally led several expeditions into long-abandoned Vardket research facilities. Desperate to find a cure, she didn't allow any obstacles to stop her search, and it was in a long-forgotten laboratory that Durumn found the answer to what she sought, along with something else: a magical device made by the Vardket that connected the wearer's mind to their fellow soldiers and their steeds, allowing them to command entire armies without delay or hesitation. She wasted no time in dispensing the cure and harnessing the power of the device, and soon thereafter the Ulnhann were reforged into a single fighting force, just in time to meet the Greherd surprise attack."

While just as fanatical as her predecessor, Vashi recognized that unity was the only path at that time that would allow her family-faction to survive. She took the Greherd into hiding, using their superior mobility and her communication drones to evade the forces of the other family-factions while coordinating their efforts across the continent. While she regretted that she wouldn't be able to indulge in blasting her enemies with sound waves till they exploded, her glee at giving their searchers a literal headache whenever they were found more than made up for it. It was from her mobile base of operations that she learned of what the others had discovered: forgotten behemoths, the dormant orbital defense networks, and the uncrewed ark ship deep beneath the surface. But more important was what little she could gather from the (relatively) unguarded feeds from their deep-space networks: the Dust-Yellow King's armada was loitering near Orebus's sun, and her calculations showed that a head-on fight would be a bad joke on their end at best. There was, however, a glimmer of hope: if she could divide the enemy and force an engagement on their terms, there would be an incredibly small window of opportunity for them to take out their enemy's commanders once and for all. She soon set to work. After a few days, a scout ship would make its way to the surface."

It took a while--and a lot of convincing--but she managed to bring the Forshu commander to her point of view. Revenge could wait, and if the others died as collateral damage in the battle ahead, so much the better! The Greherd began to assemble at several orbital defense stations and worked on bringing them back up to working order. Meanwhile, Vashi had a few specially selected candidates covertly make their way to the ark ship--a few more faces would easily get lost in the depths of its shadow. As the armada drew closer to Orebus at last, Vashi grinned and mapped their approach trajectory. She already knew that the others planned to directly assault the Dust-Yellow King's flagship, but they'd have to get there first. The skies above the continent soon darkened with thousands of golden ships as they began their attack, their hulls red-hot from reentry. Their orbital defense networks began to fire, the sound unlike any Vashi had heard before. As her cannons cleared a path to the enemy flagship, she felt a dull vibration coming from deep below the surface: the ark ship had launched--and with it, their meager hope for survival."

Their grim quest led them to a warlock performing some kind of ritual over the ominous figure of a winged wolf with a raven's head. As Randolph attacked, Ravenna found it odd that the warlock would repeatedly cry out for them to stop and listen. After a fierce battle, they defeated the warlock and his minions. However, upon touching the artifact, their memories got jolted and to their dread, they discovered that they were the ones responsible for the massacre and random murders encountered during their journey. Each night, by being near one another, their shadow beasts would possess their partner--the wolf took over Randolph's body, and the raven took Ravenna's.

    "description": "Firstborn son to a family of free-spirited tribesmen, Eerikki was raised in a kingdom of peace and prosperity. His youth was spent exploring the land with his betrothed, who enjoyed their adventures together yet became meek whenever he brought her back to her home. One day, they found an oddly shaped egg in their travels and decided in a fit of inspiration to raise it together despite their parents' objections. As the days passed, however, he began to see her less often, her arms marked with bruises whenever they spoke. Her silence with his questions infuriated him, and in the end they parted ways after a furious argument. He was heading home when he overheard a few of the villagers discussing a plan to attack a settlement not too far from theirs for mere amusement. Anxious, Eerikki followed them in the dead of night, and to his horror he discovered that a shadowy figure had convinced the people he had grown up with to raid the villages nearby. He tried to escape, but his betrothed suddenly appeared with a mad light in her eyes, her fingers dancing before his eyes as she put him to sleep. He awoke in the village square with a sharp pain in his chest as she withdrew the knife and wiped it clean, his house brightly ablaze as the screams of his parents climbed higher. His last memory was of her applying the red-hot knife to his face as he screamed, the egg cradled in his arms. Only darkness loomed thereafter."

    "description": "Firstborn son to a family of free-spirited tribesmen, Eerikki arose from a deathly slumber on an unfamiliar mountaintop. He didn't have long to ponder on this turn of events as a loud cry shattered the uneasy silence surrounding him. The egg had somehow come with him and hatched, the fragments of its shell lying scattered here and there. The small, owl-like bird struggled onto his lap, and as they both ate the meager rations he had found nearby, Eerikki realized that they were both given a second chance at life. The sound of battle, however, cut his thoughts short. As he grabbed his things and climbed down the mountain, he saw the distant hordes of demons that battled one another with no rhyme nor reason to their actions. Eerikki realized that he would have to play a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse in which survival was the only option. Soon, the days and nights blurred into one another as he discovered that the sorcery laid on his eye allowed him to arise from any death no matter how grievous. His mount was also somehow able to find him regardless of where he arose, a trick he figured would become useful in his guerilla warfare. Yet the one mystery that maddened him most amidst his endless cycle of life and death was the presence of the woman he loved in this hellish land. She had found her way there, though he knew not how, and the fuinsignum on his face burned furiously whenever she was nearby. He needed his answers, and only his pursuit of her trail would satisfy his questions."

    "description": "Kidnapped by agents of the Raug from his parents as he came into the world, Zelion knew of only one thing in his life: pain. His childhood was spent in isolation as his demonic kidnappers trained him in the varied arts of fighting. Zelion was a natural, easily ripping his opponents into bloody gibbets. Soon, the only joy he found was in murder, and the only laughter he heard was mingled in his own screams. But his skill and prowess came at a price. As time passed, his berserker rages were getting harder to control, even with the control that the Raug tried to plant into his mind. They deemed his existence a failure and placed him in hibernation against his will. Time had passed before he found himself waking up again--this time, though, bound by celestial magic that calmed down his hyper-aggressive mania and allowed him to be much more reasonable. As he grew accustomed to his rescuers--especially the magician who had laid her enchantments on his mind--he realized the horrifying gravity of the things that he had done under the demon's influence. Angered, Zelion swore that he would take his revenge on the Raug and find out what happened to his family."

The silence in his head between battles was fertile ground for his doubts to claw against his sanity. It was no wonder that he wholeheartedly threw himself into the thick of battle whenever the opportunity arose. Despite his self-destructive tendencies, his strength and martial skill was the edge that the human resistance often needed to survive the depredations of the Raug. Of course, most men would have appreciated the accolades that came with victory, especially those that came with breathy promises and shy glances from his female companions. But the young man was unused to the attention, preferring solitude instead. Despite his best efforts, his heart was soon entwined by seemingly-mutual feelings of desire with several members of their odd company, and as they journeyed into the heart of the Raug's strength, Zelion would find his fighting skill bound by feelings he could not control. It would be his only mistake."

Born with the aid of sorcery, Long was abandoned in the wilderness--a test, his mother claimed, to see if he was truly worthy to be her child. Yet upon her return, she saw a black-and-gold dragon guarding her child as he slept. Angered at heaven's favor, she vowed to make his life as miserable as possible. Despite the abuse and pain that she heaped upon the boy, Long kept smiling. He knew a potent secret, whispered to him by the dragon in his dreams: that life's troubles, no matter how grave, were an eye blink for those chosen by heaven. He awoke one night, startled at the sight of the dragon before him. He was to prepare himself and travel to a faraway land with it, for the time had come to free himself from his mother's shackles. Eager at the opportunity, he quickly dressed and departed, but not without saying a quiet goodbye to the world he was leaving behind. They soon arrived at a secluded summit in Grand Gaia, where the dragon began to teach him a secret martial art, one that blended the strengths of heaven and hell in a single thunderbolt. Eager to learn, he soon mastered both the style and his inhuman heritage, but was soon plagued by dreams of uncertainty and evil. At last, he begged the dragon for permission to leave and traveled back to Krung-go, intent on investigating the omens he was seeing. It was then that he met a young girl and discovered the true fate of his mother's death and resurrection."

    "description": "After discovering the fate of his mother, Long decided to stay with the family of his newfound companions. It was a well-spent decision, for only after an extended stay of several months were his fears about his mother's death assuaged. He had thought that she could still be redeemed by heaven despite her evil acts, but he was proven wrong. After several months, he began to dream again of the dragon, who told him that it was time for his last lesson. Despite his anxiety at the news, he decided to leave for Grand Gaia. But before he left, he had one more sparring match with his companions--a duel where his inhuman nature threatened to overwhelm his personality. Stunned, he quickly made his goodbyes and left Krung-go alone. It was when he met with his teacher that he found out the truth: a war between the gods was coming, and his power was one of those that could shake the world--or even break it. In order to master it, he needed to unlock the style's secret taolu, one that allowed the martial artist to reign as a wandering warrior king in heaven, hell, and earth simultaneously. But the price of failure was steep: if he failed, the dragon would choose to consume him utterly rather than allow his soul to be twisted by the powers waking within him. Despite the odds, Long succeeded in his goal in a fortnight and cut away the chains that bound him to mortal existence, allowing him to behold the heights of power that awaited his ascension. As he opened his eyes, the dragon congratulated him on his victory and told him to tend to his companion well before it departed, intent on forming a mercenary company to join the war of the gods. Surprised, Long turned and saw that Feng stood behind him, tears in her eyes as she embraced him in joy. They would later travel Grand Gaia together before returning to Krung-go in its time of need in a brilliant flash of fire and lightning."

As she returned to the tribe, she told them of the visions that she had gained--visions of a new war over the magical beasts and their enslavement. After much discussion, the tribe's elders decided to send her and several others to the outside world as students in the prestigious Academy to see if the disaster could be averted.

Their enemies continued to be elusive until they finally caught them in the act of binding magical beasts against their will.

Soon, news would reach her of a conflict that threatened to erupt into all-out war, and with it a plea for her aid.

The true origins of the N'an-Wang-Mu were lost and supplanted by layer upon layer of legends and half-truths for millennia. The N'an-Wang-Mu wielded mastery over the use of Xian-qi - a primordial source of nature energy that manipulated the essence of space-time, soul energy, and aeriform lightning. She could mass conjure enchanted and supercharged Nephrite Jade that could be fashioned into gears of incredible durability and offensive prowess for her subjects. The most influential and powerful deities in the world of Aimyhr were known as the \"Tetrad Arcadia\": Zeruiah in the North, Juno-Seto in the East, Tsovinar in the West, and the N'an-Wang-Mu in the South. The cataclysmic Void Rendering initiated by Ensa-Taya threw the world of Aimyhr into utter chaos, however this chaos failed to penetrate N'an-xin, for the Plateaus were inhabited by hordes of equestrian tribes that rode exotic war-bred giant insects that were even capable of flight. There were also secretive warrior monk sects that constructed strongholds in the spine of mountains separating and isolating N'an-xin from the rest of the world. The several Void forces that attempted to invade N'an-xin were defeated and blasted into oblivion by the N'an-Wang-Mu's Xian-qi and her Nephrite Jade-armed vassals. Some scholars speculate that if the warring N'an-xin tribes had ceased their in-fighting and rallied under a single banner committed to militaristic expansionism, then the whole of Aimyhr would have fallen under their rule."

The old gods that created Athensphere and its demigods were outraged at this unexpected defiance, and cast the land of Athensphere into the Endless Void. Draegar was wreaking havoc in his armored battle suit upon a garrison of Athensphere soldiers, unaware of the world's descent into doom. In the black depths of the Void, Draegar made unintentional contact with an otherworldly being, shorting out all of his systems. Faced with this unknowable horror, his mind was sent spiralling into a frenzy, and soon Draegar had lost all sense of self. For millennia, Draegar and his monsters invaded kingdoms of other worlds at the behest of these inhuman utterings. Success was rewarded with sweet respite; failure with monstrous upgrades to his battle suit, always coupled with excruciating pain.

Although victory was within Draegar's reach, Elaina managed to cast him into an unknown region of the Void, where fate brought him once again into the service of Gazia.

Before Athensphere's civil war, Draegar was appointed by Zedus as Captain of the cavalry forces, due to his unparalleled skill in mobile combat. Although he commanded a great deal of respect from his mounted troops, Draegar always held a tinge of envy for the strength of the demigods, who were handcrafted by the old gods themselves. It was this desire to stand among Ultor and Zedus that sparked a friendship with the tinkering genius Gazia. However, only those within Gazia's inner circle were able to discern the imbalance of power in the relationship—closer to that of master and servant.Many citizens of Athensphere considered Draegar as something of an oddball, as he was never seen outside of his personal combat suit. It was likely that Draegar loved battle even more than the demigod of war, Ultor; it gave him an ironclad excuse to ride in his immensely powerful mechanized battle suit. Gazia indulged his \"friend's\" demands for further upgrades and augmentations to his multiple powered suits, knowing full well he would come in handy in the future. Indeed, when Gazia first communicated his plans to take Athensphere by surprise, Draegar volunteered to lead the strike force himself. Though he could not hope to match Ultor's raw power, his battle suit—enhanced by the great Tinkerer himself—would surely level the playing field."

With the world's doom at hand, Juno-Seto linked up with Zeruiah and established a dimensional gateway, allowing the denizens of her world to escape into Grand Gaia, along with a Divine Seed housing a portion of Juno-Seto's own soul. Juno-Seto herself remained behind, devoting the rest of her powers to delay the inevitable as long as possible."

    "description": "A mythical deity from a higher plane of existence who was reborn miraculously through Zeruiah's great wisdom and foresight. Zeruiah  was presented with the Divine Seed by the refugees, and it was planted on a lush mound deep within the Vale.  The refugees performed rites and prayed daily at the mound. It took several generations, but the Seed eventually sprouted and grew into a gigantic flower. As the blossom bloomed, Juno-Seto emerged amidst a myriad of radiant colors blanketing her glorious form. Appearing to have retained her memories to a certain point, she decided to lead her people out of the Vale and journeyed towards the Far East, establishing a home on a plateau of sunlit fields and gentle warm breeze. As more of her memories and power returned, Juno-Seto began to feel a persistent sense of unease. One day, a massive rift tore the sky asunder and swarms of void entities and horrors rained down upon the world, plunging kingdoms of various races into war, and also plunging the deity's soul into disarray. A particularly menacing host of creatures then made a beeline for Juno-Seto's territory, where Juno-Seto herself and her defense force met the invaders head-on. There she encountered and locked eyes with the source of her turmoil--a being that closely resembled herself, with long flowing hair colored teal instead of pink. For a moment she doubted her own eyes, but she could feel the stranger's presence with every fiber of her being. Thus, a revelation finally dawned upon Juno-Seto... This being that called herself Ensa-Taya, was her original self that got left behind and consumed by the Ravaging Void. And with that, their epic conflict began."

Ceulfan was one of the few who was specially selected from birth by his alien masters for technological advancements beyond anyone's ken. The moment he was born, they surgically removed his limbs and replaced them with metallic prosthetics that allowed him to interface with their devices far more easily. Yet this was not enough, for he underwent numerous indoctrination sessions under intense scrutiny all his life. The Vardket expected the God-Killing Army to stay true to their convictions no matter what the cost could be, and Ceulfan was to ensure that it stayed that way. But something seemed amiss, and one day several Vardket hurriedly held a meeting with the young man and his retinue. The armies of their ancient enemies had been detected within Orebus's star system, far sooner than their initial projections had shown. The six faction-families were to stay on Orebus and prepare for the inevitable assault that would come in order to buy time for the Vardket to complete the first stage of their evacuation. The hours of silence following their departure, however, began to gnaw on Ceulfan's resolve. Only the news of the conflict between the other family-factions had broken his reverie, and in the wake of the first civil war on Orebus, Ceulfan reached out to the commander of the Greherd. He reassured him that all was not yet lost, for their final test had begun..."

The more they looked, the more they found that there were contradictions and cracks in the very beliefs that they had held true over all these years. Yet one thing was sure: their ancient enemies began to emerge in force from the bowels of space near Orebus's star, their golden yellow ships glittering against the dark as if challenging all who approached with their might. It was then that Ceulfan broached the idea of reactivating one of the Vardket's experimental superweapons to his only ally. If they could destroy their enemy's fleet, the Vardket would surely return in triumph and thanks. But waking the biosynthetic behemoth's vast array of weapons was not a task lightly undertaken, for it could only reactivate its systems with necromancy and bloody sacrifice. So the two began their preparations in earnest, even as Greherd deserters warned the other family-factions of their efforts. Soon, they managed to wake the weapon and power up its main armament: an anti-orbital energy cannon that could blast battleships in the deepest reaches of space. As the commanders of the other family-factions fought their way to a bloody reunion with Ceulfan and his ally at the behemoth's reactor core, he managed to fire off a blast against their enemy's fleet. Yet despair gripped his heart as the shot simply glanced off their ships, the vast armada not even bothering to defend itself. The last thing that he heard were his screams as he tried to get one more shot off..."

After Durumn's death and the destruction of the necromantic superweapon, he reluctantly assumed the leadership role of the Ulnhann and begun the arduous task of rebuilding their family-faction's resources with the others. Many criticized his hands-off approach, and soon he was forced to impose order after an attempt at splintering the faction nearly succeeded. Yet his biggest fear was that the enigmatic enemy that they were trained to fight would soon make an appearance. It was a belief that made him spend many sleepless nights as he poured over maps and watched the skies while on patrol. Some called him paranoid, while others saw his actions as overly cautious. But several months later, his efforts would pay off: a single craft that shone with an otherworldly golden sheen was spotted crash-landing to the south of the continent, and with a sinking heart he left with a task force to investigate the matter."

Concerned, Enile called for a convocation of all the remaining family-faction commanders as soon as he could. But only three answered his call, with the Forshu and Greherd refusing to answer his messages. Despite his frustration, he immediately went to work on formulating a battle plan with the others. It was clear that the best strategy was a defensive one, stalling for time while obtaining more information on their plans and goals. Soon, the land around Orebus was churned and changed as they began reinforcing defensive emplacements while gathering as much resources as they could. It was only a matter of time before their deep-space sensors began showing the signs that the enemy's forces were returning in force, and soon their golden ships were descending from orbit into the atmosphere. As the battle raged in the heavens, Enile could only wonder why the invaders were scattered instead of fighting as a cohesive whole before setting them in his sights. Could they bleed? He was about to find out."

A daring child prodigy, she soon became quite the headache for her family as she kept pestering her tutors (and later, complete strangers) with the oddest of questions about heka, their unique form of word-magic. Thankfully, the priests learned about her skill and \"encouraged\" her family to allow her to join the priesthood, where she could continue her studies under the proper tutelage - and more importantly, away from any potential troublemakers or temptations. It was here that she mastered the magical arts, often spending time in the evening hours honing her skills by herself. It was here that she met a softly-spoken priestess who seemed to have a habit of sneaking out at night. Curious, she followed her and discovered that she was responsible for feeding the sick and homeless with what scraps were left from the temple meals. A little convincing was all it took for her to join the priestess in her nocturnal excursions, and soon they spent much time together with her bodyguard. But ill omens seemed to slowly stalk her shadow, and her unease grew until a shard of celestial power somehow found its way into her soul. As the earthly and divine mingled, she could not help her body suddenly changing subtly to accommodate the godhood that she had suddenly gained..."

She could already feel the aching, trembling divide between the material and immaterial, with skeletal shadows huddled over at the edges of her vision. Acting quickly, she headed to the palace, where she found out that her erstwhile companions had killed the God-King in self-defense. As they discussed what to do, she could feel a slow, steady pulse of energy coming from the east. She decided that matters at the palace could be handled by her friends - she had to investigate the pulses, and soon. As she traveled eastward, she saw for herself the extent of the damage that the God-King's manipulation of magic had done, and the slowly growing tide of refugees heading westward who sought refuge from the rising dead. Her investigations showed that the further east she traveled, the more often the unliving were reported to rove the land, hungry for flesh and blood. Her arrival at the energy's origin confirmed her worst fears: the wall, originally meant to keep the desert out, was now the last defense of the living against the hungry zombies that stormed its ramparts. She realized that the hordes were growing in size, more than she and the defenders could handle. With a single breath, she sent a hasty message to her friends for aid, just in time for the worst monsters of the God-King's undead legions to crest the horizon..."

When she tire of them, she drained their life force to maintain her youth and beauty. With the aid of a mysterious Summoner, Xie’Jing was finally defeated by a feisty young lady by the name of Fang. The Summoner was able to provide Noel with valuable information regarding the fallen witch, thus the development of the mock unit Xie’ Jing. While not quite as formidable as the original witch, the unit Temptress Xie’ Jing is more than just a pretty face. Her mastery over the elements and her reputation as a plague bringer will introduce unsuspecting foes a whole new world of pain. "

Angered at the failure of her initial plans, Xie'jing subjugated hordes of hungry ghosts and evil spirits, unleashing plagues and sickness across the land of Krung-go. The land shuddered in pain and was almost plunged into the arms of hell, but her evil agenda was thwarted thanks to the aid of the heroic young warriors. Yet the land did not recover quickly, and in some places one can still hear her ever-sibilant laughter in the shadows."

The surface was bleak and desolate, but there were intact structures, presumably from past civilizations. For a millennium, this landscape endured, as though immune to the ravages of time. Then, in a paradoxical phenomenon, an eerie chime reverberated through the crevasses of the earth. Within the tenebrous subterranean depths, a shriveled husk began to vibrate periodically. Eventually, it started to peel and a violet glow illuminated the caverns. An entity in the form of a nubile and tantalizing lady emerged from a timeless slumber. She possessed immense powers, but was filled with darkness and an uncontrollable desire for death and destruction. She also had a regal and vain disposition. Yearning servants to wait upon her and gaze upon her beauty, she summoned void elementals and spirit-insects, enslaved to do her bidding and beautify the subterranean areas. While in her presence, her subjects would ominously chant her name: Ensa-Taya."

She would hurl destructive storms up onto the surface, sundering the bleak land. Within Ensa-Taya's divine soul, there was a gnawing void. The pulsing emptiness threatened to drive her insane. She could also sense a faint pull, but could not pinpoint a direction at all. One day, that faint sensation spiked in strength. Ensa-Taya traced it diligently in great anticipation, and discovered an unusual spot framed by a circle of towering stalagmites and residue particles from something ancient. Without hesitation, she weaved intricate flows of dark and void energies together and channeled it into the spot. There was a great flash and explosion, and after the dust settled, a colossal gateway shimmered into existence. Ensa-Taya smiled in triumph."

Ensa-Taya sent her insectoid spirit plague into the gateway first to serve as her vanguard and scouts. They were followed by swarms of void elementals of all sizes which had been reshaped for the sole purpose of battle superiority, while greater void entities acted as commanders and led invasions into the various civilizations of the target world. Ensa-Taya feasted her eyes upon the bountiful land full of entertaining lifeforms ripe for enslaving. Leaving the rest of the invasion to her subordinates, she turned her gaze towards the East and headed towards the source that was pulling at her soul stronger than ever before, leaving a trail of ruin in her wake. When she laid eyes on the regal being that bore a striking resemblance to herself, unfathomable emotions welled up from within and she went psychotic from the clashing lust, love, hate, and rage consuming her mind. Historic tales from dusty tomes regarding that mythological era depicted a monumental battle between Ensa-Taya and Juno-Seto that lasted seven moons, culminating in Juno-Seto's imminent defeat by her opponent's overwhelming void-enhanced power. Records state that in the final moments of the battle, Juno-Seto caught Ensa-Taya off-guard by taking fatal damage in order to lock her in an embrace. A blinding pillar of light that shook the heavens and dissolved the dimensional gateway then followed this bittersweet moment. To this day, an indestructible crystalline spire encasing the two deities entwined by vines and petals remains as part of the battle's aftermath."

It's main purpose was actually to serve as an energy conduit that could channel the energies of the void into Zenia, amplifying her powers exponentially.

But in the process, the artificial intelligence system that had overridden Zenia's control over her own body malfunctioned under the immense energy load.

Were it not for one madman's lust for power, Zenia most certainly would've had the potential to become one of Athensphere's greatest heroes-—if not the greatest. Reports taken from Summoners during the appearance of the void rift over Grand Gaia gave similar testimonies on sighting a heavily augmented cybernetic warrior, later identified as Zenia. Reports also indicated that it was Zenia who single handedly closed the void rift, but at the cost of her own life. To give a rough estimate on the amount of power required to execute such a feat, Noel-—head of the Summoner's Research Lab-—revealed that the task would demand at least a thousand times the energy needed to power the entire Imperial Capital Randall for a month. Had Zenia's abduction been prevented, it is quite likely she would've become one of Gazia's greatest obstacles and an invaluable ally to Zedus. Zenia's ability to traverse the void between worlds might have been the demigod's last hope for escape. Her sacrifice might've condemned her own kind to the void for all eternity, but her actions have prevented Gazia's influence from spreading into the world of Grand Gaia."

Their silence only encouraged his detractors, and soon matters had come to a head as a fight broke out between his enemies and his allies while he was still recovering from his latest attack. Fearing the worst, Keres struggled to stand, every ounce of strength he possessed spent as his body rebelled against him. Angry at his own weakness, he shouted for them to stop. A moment later, he realized that someone had slipped a blade into his chest in the confusion before losing consciousness. He awoke later only to realize that his body had been transformed by the Vardket--strengthened with magic and sorcery that only they understood. He had passed their test, they said, and his faith was proof that he deserved to have the shortcomings of his body removed. Rewarded with a new lease on life and a seemingly predatory blade, he was immediately ordered to lead his family-faction and train them for the inevitable battle against the gods. Although he was suspicious at the turn of events, he did not dare voice his objections, even as he executed his opponents at his master's behest.

With his own allies and friends in the crosshairs, it was going to be a matter of time before war would break out once again. Determined to thwart their aims, he reached out to the others who were favorably inclined to his cause. A coalition of similar interests was born, and many nights were spent training and planning together for the inevitable.

His allies stood by his side as he led the midnight charge from the heavens, dropping onto the enemy facility from his family-faction's massive skyship. His blade drank deeply, its voice howling in glee and hunger as the opposition was cut into pieces. Amidst explosions, screams and magic, Keres made his way into the deepest levels of the superweapon's chambers, refusing to let his many injuries slow him down.

The fact that the superweapon had fired one shot into the heavens before it was destroyed was definitely not going to go unnoticed, and speeding up their recovery from the devastation was critical towards ensuring their survival. Meanwhile, most of the Vardket defensive networks languished in neglect, their own automated systems deactivated because their alien masters did not trust their subjects with all the command codes. Savei began the arduous task of reverse-engineering their programs, while the rest of his family-faction worked to salvage whatever equipment they could find. When news of an alien ship reached him, he immediately joined the others at the crash site. But the insectile crew, though injured, proved more troublesome than they had expected.

Despite the lack of accurate information about the King's own defenses, it was agreed that this rare opportunity to take out their leadership would be their best chance of success. Savei drilled relentlessly with the other members of the assault team, with every scrap of knowledge that they could find pored over night after night. As the enemy fleet arrived and began their descent, they began to set their plan into action. Explosions filled the air as Orebus's skies were plunged into chaos. Every time the tide of battle seemed to turn in their favor, the enemy had another wave of hungry, insectile soldiers to throw at them. At last, they found a gap in their defenses and launched their assault. In the hot depths of the enemy flagship, they found the Dust-Yellow King seated on its throne. As Savei ignited his dark matter spear, the alien ruler arose with a hundred golden weapons gripped in its arms. The last battle of the Vardket had begun."

During a ritual meditative session, Ihsir divined the massive wars that would come to devastate Grand Gaia. He also foresaw the eventual fall of his allies, the Disciples, and attempted to make his sooth known to them. However, they did not hold the human in high regard, dismissing his prophecy as the ramblings of a madman. The Disciples convened without Ihsir's presence and decided unanimously to commit him to a magical prison for insanity. Ihsir, who had predicted that this might come to pass, saw no way to save his allies and abandoned them to their fates. He stole an extremely powerful magical artifact created from the skull of an old demon, using it to change his form at will to evade capture. <br>In his exile, Ihsir searched ceaselessly for a way to free Grand Gaia from the ravages of destiny. He used the skull to prolong his life beyond its natural limits, slowly but surely trading away his humanity to pursue his lofty goal. But Ihsir despaired of ever succeeding in his quest. Embittered by centuries of dead ends and diminishing humanity, his approach shifted from savior to avenger. Grand Gaia would inevitably burn, and Ihsir would make sure that the dispassionate and self-entitled gods perish together in the flames. There would be massive casualties from the wars that would ravage Grand Gaia, Ihsir reasoned. If only there was a way to muster the dead as a resource..."

    "description": "Neferet was groomed from birth as another pawn in the kingdom's intrigues thanks to her divine heritage manifesting early. Yet she found more joy in the solitude of nature and the quiet night, refusing every offer made for marriage. One such evening, she found a dying falcon, its body broken beyond aid. Weeping, she held it close to her breast as it expired in peace. The bird's corpse suddenly burst into smokeless fire, the flames touching her eyes before granting her a vision of the gods. As she came home, she told her family that she was entering the God-King's priesthood. It shocked many, for only a privileged few were permitted to marry such exalted ones. Yet she succeeded despite their fears, and she was soon known as a fair judge of character and a trustworthy soul, although her nighttime excursions--mostly spent defending the outcasts and the poor--caused many to question her true motives. The outcry against her led the God-King to assign a sharp-eyed bodyguard to her - to keep her safe within the palace walls, he claimed. Angered, she slipped out one night, but was surprised to discover that her bodyguard had followed her with ease and seemed to share her sentiments about the situation. Matters came to a head when the God-King's own son tried to cut down an innocent man, framed for a crime she instinctively knew he didn't commit. Her shout of anger shook the walls of the palace that day, and for a moment it seemed that every light had dimmed momentarily. The mad God-King swung his blade at her, but her bodyguard shielded her from the blow. Without a second thought, she wove her divine heritage and struck the God-King with all her might, ripping his divinity into shreds as she made part of it her own. As the ecstasy of power filled her body, a sound ripped the air with triumph--the falcon's cry as it devoured its prey."

She saw the truth for herself, and it was horrifying. The laws of nature that she had thought immutable were broken and rebound into the God-King's divine power, doled out in drips and drabs to further his selfish agenda. This was not without price, as the desert grew without limit at the borders of their kingdom. Yet beyond the desert were worse terrors, for the monsters that hated humanity had seen its defenses weakened and were moving like hungry sharks after blood. The shattered fragments of the God-King's power had settled into various places, items, and people across the kingdom, and Neferet realized that she had to find as many of them as she could in order to weather the coming darkness. Yet before she could do so, her bodyguard--flush with the power of death--begged her to help him bridge the yawning chasm of soul-debt that the God-King had left behind. And so their greatest trial had begun, for he could only permit the death of those she could judge guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. At first, the task was all too easy, yet every trial wore on her soul, and soon despair clung to her every heartbeat. Desperate for a solution, Neferet left one moonless night and began her search for those who possessed the remaining shards of divinity across the land. Time would see her return to her companion's side in his hour of need...but not unscarred."

Her conjurer then bound her to his service in gaining mortal companionship, a task she was eager to satisfy. Yet with every hasty affair, she found that his claims of love were utterly false, and every night she would visit the broken-hearted women and eat their tear-soaked dreams. One day, she had enough of his foolishness and wrapped the conjurer in gossamer strings, squeezing him tightly until his mind and body broke. With the magical power she had accumulated, she twisted his form into a piece from the games of chess that they had played over and over again. So began her journey across the land, her sybaritic lifestyle explained as the frivolous eccentricity of a wealthy noblewoman's daughter who enjoyed games of chess as a pastime. Those that she defeated were turned into mindless thralls, eager to serve her whims. Those that won were given trinkets of power, mostly wasted with their feeble efforts to gain fame before they came crawling to her throne once again. And as the years drew by, Luina realized a horribly comforting truth: what were mortals, but miserable piles of secrets and broken promises? They never deserved love, she thought. Instead, adulation of their superiors was a better fate for them. Soon, her depredations caught the attention of the Raug, as a mystic mark began to manifest in her essence..."

And so she waited, playing the long game while biding her time and perfecting her curses. Each success only proved to her twisted mind that mortals could not be trusted with love or happiness, for they didn't deserve one whit of it. With every day that passed, her collection of transformed slaves waxed and waned, yet she could not bear to part with her king, the first piece that she had acquired all those years ago. But the schemes within schemes began to bore her, and the forces of the Inquisition that hounded her were starting to be more than just an annoyance. Finally, her luck ran out, and she was forced to flee from her enemies on the backs of her bleeding, mindless pieces. Yet her apparent failure was overlooked by the Raug, who ordered her to report to one of their pet projects. He immediately set her on her newest target: a handsome warrior who rode a majestic bird of prey as he scoured the island for the woman he loved. It was child's play to pluck her face from his unguarded dreams, and even easier to bind his heart with the smallest of strings. Soon, she would lead him into death after death - a perfect candidate to become the newest king for her own collection."

These \"onion knights\" were recognized by the kingdom for their valiance and sacrifice in mankind's greatest times of need. They were revered and honored by the peasant folk, but scorned by the highborn. The man known as Galtier was one such onion knight. Born the son of a farmer, Galtier proved his worth as a mighty warrior by slaying a powerful demon wolf that lived in the dark woods. Thus Galtier was handsomely rewarded with his very own land, manor and title. Having tasted the power and wealth he never had in his entire life, Galtier desired for more. He commissioned a master blacksmith to forge him a weapon unlike any other, using the fangs of the demon wolf he slew. After the weapon was forged, Galtier struck down the very smith who forged the weapon, along with his helpless daughter. He could not risk having anyone come into possession of a weapon more powerful than his. He alone would be the hero of the people.

Once the tainted scythe was forged, the demon was finally able to take over the darkness within Galtier's own soul. Turning his blade upon the people he once swore to protect, Galtier thus began his descent into madness and chaos. Were it not for the power of the ancient wisp Jack and the young girl who prevented the fallen knight's reign of terror, the man once known as Galtier would have become a living husk for the demon that consumed him from within. No longer would the onion knight fight in the name of his kingdom. The demon that was once known as Galtier would eventually bring about the downfall of the kingdom, pillaging the lands to feed his greed. The fact that the despoiler continued to live would inadvertently twist the fate of yet another innocent life. The girl who would become the guardian of the woods would fall into darkness herself, becoming yet another powerful being of darkness.

Born from an unwanted union between an elf raider and his hostage, he was abandoned by his father at a young age. But he never gave up, learning as many trades as he could while moving on once trouble came knocking at his door. Despite the hardship and racism that he was exposed to as he grew older, he always had a positive outlook on life. After escaping from his father's tribe, he made his way to the Imperial Capital after hearing that the Inquisition would treat him as an equal. It was here that he enlisted in their ranks and met the people that he would call his friends, including a lone wolfhound that would later accompany him everywhere he went. His stay with the Inquisition, however, was not as perfect as he thought it was. Corruption and vice was present in its ranks, and he nearly came to blows over it, save for the efforts of his mentors and his friends. His ability to stay in trouble didn't last forever, and he--together with his friends--were volunteered as part of the Inquisition's forces defending Rehdoon. It was their grave--but a vampire's flight of fancy brought Kielazar back to life as a creature of the night. She took him on as her apprentice and traveled with her across the land, learning the many sword arts that she had learned in her years of existence. The world, however, was an unkind place, and they soon went to the vampire courts to plead for their assistance in resisting the Raug. They refused to let him speak to their Council, and their answer was inevitable. They were on their own, forcing them to make the perilous journey to the Imperial Capital to join its defenders. The night before they entered the Capital's walls, Kielazar was awakened by his mistress, who warned him that the vampires wanted to take back the blades of their ancient ancestor--the First-who-Walked--from her guardianship. With painful sorcery, she passed them on to him to watch over before vanishing into the night, the corpses of her would-be assassins already decaying around their camp. Left alone once again, Kielazar reentered the capital in secret. It would be a short stay, as the city would fall to the Raug several days later without much unified resistance. Determined to fight the Raug, Kielazar began to gather those who resisted the demonic invasion under his banner as an all-too familiar symbol began to appear on his body..."

It was here that his skills and resolve were tested time and time again. Days began to blur into nights, and it soon became a challenge just to wake up the next day. But they persevered despite the odds. In a dark cavern, he met a mysterious spirit who would go on to locate individuals with valuable skills for the resistance: a determined necromancer, a young conjurer with her companion spirit, and a forgotten berserker. As they continued their battles, he realized that the young man needed a mature authority in his life and decided to mentor him as much as he could. Time, however, was not on their side. They discovered that the Raug had divided their forces, with the majority laying siege to the Isengrim in the north. The rest were stationed in the ruins of the Imperial Capital, but more demons were seen to stream into the city and not leave. The spirit told him in confidence that they had to return to the accursed island of Fuindor immediately, although it could not clearly say why. While surprised, he agreed to it. He was shocked at the reunion with the woman who looked like his mentor, as well as her companions, but the spirit claimed them to be friends. They began the arduous trek back to the mainland, as troubling omens of bloody skies and rains filled with dead birds greeted them on their path. One night, he awoke to cries of treachery, his worst fears confirmed as news of the disappearance of the berserker and the woman calling herself his mother reached his ears. With a weary sigh, he dressed and prepared for the inevitable battle that lay ahead of him."

The ghosts that she had come across had bemoaned their fate at being driven away from the forest's grasp, while a ghoul warned her that a certain scythe-wielding witch had made it her home. With a lightness to her step, Beatrix danced across the witch's wards and plopped herself down on her couch, happy to enjoy a night by the fire after a long trip. Her intrusion, of course, did not go unnoticed. She crossed blades with the witch, and after several days of fighting realized that she was quite the match for her skills. As they sat down to catch their breath, Beatrix playfully proposed a momentary truce before her departure. To her surprise, the witch reluctantly agreed, and so they spent the night in hesitant revelry. As Beatrix returned to the underworld, she wondered if she would ever see the witch again.

Often depicted next to powerful figures in history, some speculate that perhaps he even whispered in their ears. But, could a simple human manage to conquer time? Nothing is known about him, only rumors and legends. However...there is someone in present day who matches the figure's description--a man who used to advise a good king during his reign over a beautiful kingdom. After his king died, the old man decided to live in a small cottage and then befriended a young squire, helping him with his knight training. Could he be the same man from the legends?"

The crushing defeat that followed set the Maidens in search of their own power, and Lico, unamused at their weakness, abandoned them for more thrilling battles to satiate her bloodlust.<br><br>When Fennia rallied the Battle Maidens once more after having visions of a powerful artifact, Lico was conspicuously missing from the reunion.
